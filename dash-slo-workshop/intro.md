# Ensuring Reliability with SLOs 

Welcome and thank you for joining us! In this workshop you will be learning the basics for configuring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in Datadog. 

For many years now, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of users using digital services in their everyday lives. No matter the demographic, people across the world are depending on these products to complete tasks, to connect with others, to manage their lives and to get information. Every user expects the product they're using to work as intended when they need it. In other words, all users expect a digital product to be reliable. 

During this continued surge, the software industry has increasingly adopted the agile methodology's fail-fast approach to development and coupled it with complex distributed applications and dynamic infrastructure. So, how then do we track and ensure the reliability of our products when the complexity and pace of development continues to increase?

In the past, one would simply track uptime. However, uptime on its own is a poor measure of reliability. That's where SLOs come in. SLOs help you understand the true health of your systems and how your end users experience them. Poorly defined SLOs means you have little to no visibility into the successes and failures of those apps and their services. In this workshop youâ€™ll learn how to define SLOs and monitor the right service level indicators to ensure reliability. Armed with this information, we'll introduce chaos into a sample application and learn how to respond effectively using error budgets.

We'll be running a docker-compose command, allowing us to spin up an entire environment for an e-commerce Ruby web app called storedog.

You'll be using the Datadog account created for you. Use the username and password credentials assigned to you to follow along with Datadog open in another browser or tab.
